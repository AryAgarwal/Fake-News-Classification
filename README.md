# Fake-News-Classification
# Problem Statement
The dissemination of fake news is a significant challenge due to the abundance of user-generated content, speed of news, and the rise of deepfake technology. Deepfakes create significant challenges for media outlets and fact-checkers to provide accurate information. Developing new technologies and approaches to verify news authenticity is crucial in the age of deepfakes. Balancing the need for accurate information and free speech further compounds this issue. Innovative solutions are required to effectively detect and combat the spread of fake news.

# Data Preparation

In this section, i am going to do the following tasks using Python and NLP libraries:

Check for duplicate values in the data and remove them if any are found.
Combine two datasets into one.
Dropping columns not to be used.
Remove all punctuations.
Convert all the text to lower case.
Create a word cloud.
Remove stopwords from the combined dataset.
Lemmatize the text data.
Split the data into training and testing set.
Tokenize the text data

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the model is highly accurate and performs very well on the data it was trained and tested on. It can predict outcomes with 99% accuracy and has high recall and precision scores, indicating its ability to identify relevant results and minimize incorrect results
